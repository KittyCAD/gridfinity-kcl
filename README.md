THIS REPO IS BEING ARCHIVED. THE KCL FILES FOR GRIDFINITY HAVE BEEN MOVED HERE <https://github.com/KittyCAD/kcl-samples>

Working repo to build a faithful KCL Implementation of [Gridfinity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ra_9zU-mnl8) from the ground up. 

Gridfinity is originally developed by [Zack Freedman](https://www.youtube.com/c/ZackFreedman/about)

## Guidelines for contributing

Merge PRs to the `next` branch, not main.

Gridfinity conforms to a set of style guidelines to ensure consistency and readability. <https://github.com/KittyCAD/kcl-samples?tab=readme-ov-file#guidelines-for-adding-samples>

1. **File Naming:** Name your KCL files descriptively and concisely, using hyphens to separate words (e.g., flange.kcl, ball-bearing.kcl).

2. **File Header:** Include a title comment at the top of each file, followed by a brief description explaining what the model is and its typical use cases.

3. **Inline Comments:** Use inline comments to explain non-obvious parts of the code. Each major section should have a comment describing its purpose.

4. **Constants:** Define constants at the beginning of your KCL files for any values that might change or need to be reused (e.g., dimensions, angles).
